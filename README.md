Published magically via GitHub Pages.

## Local test setup (Ubuntu 14.04)

* Install a modern Ruby version
  * `sudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng`
  * `sudo apt-get install ruby2.3 ruby2.3-dev bundler`
* Follow https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/
* Install the latest node.js
  * Rather than a system level install, I just put the binary release in my
    home dir and make sure `node` and `npm` are on my path.

## Dev

* Run `update` to get latest `github-pages` installed
* Run `serve` script in repo root
