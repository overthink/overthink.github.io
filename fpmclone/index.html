    <h1>Fast multiplayer client/server demo</h1>

    <p>Clone of <a href="http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm_live.html">Gabriel
    Gambetta's original demo</a>, adding entity interpolation.  I made this in
    order to better understand the original, and to learn about developing
    TypeScript projects.  His series of articles explaining <a
    href="http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fast_paced_multiplayer.html">Fast-Paced
    Multiplayer games</a> is an excellent read, and essential to understanding
    this.</p>

    <p>Disclaimer: I'm not a game developer, and this is the first gamey thing
    I've tried, so beware of the <a
    href="https://github.com/overthink/fpmclone">code</a>.</p>

    <p>Writeup <a href="#discussion">below</a> with ideas to try out with this.</p>

    <h2 id="discussion">Things to try</h2>

    <p>With default settings, move player 3 around. Note how smoothly player
    3's view renders.  Now move player 1 or player 2 the same way and note how
    slow or jumpy their views update.  This shows the effect of client
    prediction and input reconciliation. (Same as Gabriel's original
    demo.)</p>

    <p>Now observe player 3's view as you move player 1 & 2 around.  Note how
    players 1 and 2 move smoothly -- but delayed -- in player 3's view
    compared to everyone else's view.  This is entity interpolation (EI) at
    work.</p>

    <p>Turn EI on for all players, but give player 1 and 2
    very different lag values (say 2000 ms, and 20ms).  Then move player 3
    around and observe how the other players see the state of the world.  Note
    how the high-lag player's view of the world is considerably delayed, but
    still smooth.</p>

    <p>Check out the recommendations for things to try in the <a
    href="http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm_live.html">original demo</a>.</p>

    <p>TODO: add something to demonstrate lag compensation, the remaining
    concept from the article series that is not demonstrated.</p>

    <h2>What's with the weird "easing" when EI is on and server update frequency is small?</h2>

    <p>I thought this was a bug at first, but it's working as designed.  It's
    a limitation of our naive interpolation function and world state.  When
    world state updates only arrive very infrequently, like once a second,
    players using EI assume a past movement occurred at uniform speed over the
    entire time between world states.  For example, assume the server sends
    world states updates every second, and player 3 is using EI.  If player 1,
    e.g., moves a tiny bit over 100ms and then stops, player 3 will see that
    tiny movement in world state updates that are one second apart, and our
    interpolation function will drag out the tiny movement over a period of
    one second instead of 100 ms.  If you set the server update rate to be
    something slightly more aggressive, like 5 times a second, this effect is
    much less noticeable.  At 20 times a second it's invisible. Another fix
    would be to send a more detailed world state that includes where the
    player was every 10 ms or something. (This is mentioned in the <a
    href="http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm3.html#entity-interpolation">original
    articles</a>, but I had to learn the hard way, as usual.)</p>
